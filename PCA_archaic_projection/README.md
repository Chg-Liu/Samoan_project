# PCA archaic projection

In this analysis, we generated a PC space by using genomes of Altai Neaderthal, Denisovan and Chimpanzee. Then we projected Samoans and 1000G populations onto the plane generated by the first two PCs.

We used [runsmartpca.sh](runsmartpca.sh) to run smartpca for this analysis. The dataset used here is same as used in [fstats](../fstats). 
Heterozygozity outliers and relatedness of deuplicates, 1st and 2nd have been removed. variants with maf not less than 0.01 and LD pruning passed were kept. The dataset were converted to the format of EIGENSOFT.

[par.txt](par.txt) contains all parameters in which [poplist.txt](poplist.txt) listed the names of populations used for generating the PC space.

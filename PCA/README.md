# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

We used [runpca.sh](runpca.sh) to do principal component analysis on the Samoan dataset and the merged dataset (the output of exclude_relate.sh, see [Data_processing](../Data_processing)). 
Both of the datasets are with heterozygosity outliers removed and relatedness of duplicates, 1st and 2nd degree excluded. 

The software we used here is [flashpca](https://github.com/gabraham/flashpca).

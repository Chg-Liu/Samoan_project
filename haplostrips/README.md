# haplostrips

For each gene region siginificantly associated with diastolic blood pressure,
we addtionally extracted the genotypes in the region from HGDP and Choin dataset by \[gene_name\].extract_HGDP_Choin.sh.

Then we ran \[gene_name\].haplostrips.sh to analyze the haplotype structure. 
The first haplotype of the archaic genome that contributed to the gene region has been used as the reference haplotype.

# ADMIXTURE
We used [runnextflow.sh](runnextflow.sh) for runing the nexflow pipline [ADMIXTURE.nf](ADMIXTURE.nf) with the config file [ADMIXTURE_Samoan_worldwide.config)](ADMIXTURE_Samoan_worldwide.config) for ADMIXTURE analysis.

We ran 10 replicates for K=2-9 on the merged dataset with maf filtered and LD pruned (the output of filter_missing_maf_LD.sh in [Data processing](../Data_processing/)).

Please see [here](https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PIBv1_manuscript/blob/main/Instructions/ADMIXTURE_README.md) for the instructions for running the nexflow pipeline of ADMIXTURE.

# ADMIXTURE
We ran 10 replicates for K=2-9 on the merged dataset with maf filtered and LD pruned (the output of filter_missing_maf_LD.sh in [Data processing](../Data_processing/).

Please see [here](https://github.com/YourePrettyGood/PIBv1_manuscript/blob/main/Instructions/ADMIXTURE_README.md) for the instructions for running the nexflow pipeline of ADMIXTURE.
